### Assignment
Please create a simple test suite that verifies functionality of a public user management API available at https://m3o.com/user/api.

### Some example flows that you could cover in your tests
* Creation of a new user with mandatory/optional fields and verification that it was saved successfully
* Update of existing user 
* Deletion of existing user
* Some error scenarios, like trying to create a user with duplicated id or missing/invalid information

### Our expectations for this task
* Please use Java or Kotlin as programming language and Maven or Gradle as a build tool.
* Use API testing library of your preference (for example, RestAssured, Retrofit or similar).
* Optional: think about reporting or some other way to make test results quick to interpret and test failures easier to investigate.
* Include description of your solution, choice of tools and instruction on how to execute the tests in the readme file.
* Please push your code to the provided git repository and submit your assignment within 5 calendar days.

### Tips
* Let us know if you have any questions - we're happy to help.
* Keep it simple, no need to spend too much time on this task or implement more than 5 test cases.
* Think about easiness of adding new test cases and making changes when building your test suite/framework.
* If there is something you would have improved or done differently if you had more time, please feel free to mention it in the readme file.
